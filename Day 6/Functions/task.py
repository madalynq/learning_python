def my_function():
    print("hello")
    print("bye")

my_function()      ####"calling" the function


### this allows a block of code to all be carried out at once. shorthand, in a way. calling a function can simplify code
### rather than typing each individual step out

### creating code for Reeborg's world, challenge is to get the robot to turn right when there is no "right turn" in
### the code, create a function that carries out the process.


# def turn_right():
#   turn_left()
#   turn_left()
#   turn_left()
# turn_right()


#created a "jump" function:

# def jump():
#   move()
#   turn_left()
#   move()
#   turn_right()
#   move()
#   turn_right()
#   move()
#   turn_left()

### challenge was to make the robot jump a hurdle, 6 times. and to simplify code as much as possible.(loops)

### for hurdle in range(0,6):
###     jump()
