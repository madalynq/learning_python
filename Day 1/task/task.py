# exercise changing variables: We have 2 variables glass1 and glass2.
# glass1 contains milk and glass2 contains juice.
# Write 3 lines of code to switch the contents of the variables.
# You are not allowed to type the words "milk" or "juice".
# You are only allowed to use variables to solve this exercise.

glass1 = "milk"
glass2 = "juice"

#think of actual glasses and switching liquids in real life

glass3 = glass1
glass1 = glass2
glass2 = glass3
